This repository contains R markdown and netlogo code generated for my artificial life final project. I would like to broaden the project to include a simple simulation of Ph in an aquarium to simulate more appropriate data for exploration of nonlinear dynamical statistical measures for managing overall system health. The final paper for the course is also included. I found negative results, but learned enough to move forward with a more appropriate model.

## Abstract
Entropic measures have been shown to be useful in the classification of overall dynamics in biological systems
[1]. Entropic measures were used to attempt to classify the dynamics in a simple biological agent based Netlogo
model of lateral gene transfer in early phagocytic prokaryotic life. Within the model a set of parameters were
previously found where the probability of the emergence of the super organisms was high. Several experiments
were run recording the number of each organism present in the model. Time series data of this activity was
recorded and used to measure multiscale multivariate sample entropy, MSMVSampEn. First the entropy measures
were used to infer complexity using only total population data. Then, The entropy values were then used to
predict the emergence of super-organisms at t time steps in the future. Analysis was inconclusive. The analysis
could be improved with different measures than simply population and more labeled data.
